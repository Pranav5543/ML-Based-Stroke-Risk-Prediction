ML-Based Stroke Risk Prediction
📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on a variety of medical attributes. The goal is to enable early detection and timely medical intervention, thus improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare resources.

📌 Objective
To develop an ML model that can accurately predict heart disease risk.

Use data preprocessing and logistic regression techniques.

Evaluate model performance and interpret predictions.

📊 Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Description: The dataset includes several medical features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, with a target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

IDE: Jupyter Notebook

Libraries Used:

numpy – for numerical operations

pandas – for data manipulation and analysis

matplotlib & seaborn – for data visualization

scikit-learn – for ML modeling (train/test split, logistic regression, evaluation)

📌 Process Workflow
Data Loading & Exploration

Load dataset using pandas.

Understand features and target variable.

Check for missing values and perform exploratory data analysis.

Data Preprocessing

Handle null values if any.

Convert categorical variables if needed.

Normalize or standardize data if required.

Model Development

Split the dataset into training and test sets using train_test_split.

Build a Logistic Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.

Train the model and make predictions.

Model Evaluation

Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.

Interpret the results to assess model performance.

✅ Results
The logistic regression model showed promising results in classifying patients with and without heart disease.

Evaluation metrics were used to validate the model's accuracy and reliability.
